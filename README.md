# KCLHarvardV1 a Bibliography Style Implementation of King's Harvard V1 for LaTeX
Bibliography style for LaTeX documents that tries to accomplish the same look as the King’s Harvard V1 referencing style (http://libguides.kcl.ac.uk/reference/KingsHarvardV1) that is used in several departments at King’s College London.

Created with the help of [custom-bib](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/custom-bib?lang=en) maintained by [Patrick W. Daly](https://www.ctan.org/author/daly) and some additional adjustments by me.

For details and examples, please check out the [kclharvardv1_readme.pdf](/kclharvardv1_readme.pdf) that basically describes everything you need to know.

This bibliography style is also an optional part of [KCLInformaticsMScProjectLayout](https://github.com/sebastianzillessen/KCLInformaticsMScProjectLayout) an unofficial Master thesis LaTeX template by [Sebstian Zillessen](https://github.com/sebastianzillessen) and me. Check it out!

# Note
Please note that this bibliography style does not support the on the official website described entry types **maps**, **ebooks** and **clinical and (other) guidelines**. Furthermore the **chapter** entry type does not completely show-up like the officially proposed representation, but it is fairly close. Overall I think this bibliography style is perfectly usable for most of us and provides the entry types that probably 90% of us actually need. Nevertheless I don't give any kind of warranty!

Please feel free to contribute!
